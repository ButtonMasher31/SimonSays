SimonSays   Project #01   10 December 2017

I got the idea for this project when I was browsing the internet and I 
realised how many versions of the classic Simon Says games there.  I was 
thinking about how they worked and I realised it wouldn't be that hard to make
one, so that's what I ended up doing. Included is the python script,fritzing 
files and an image of the fritzing circuit diagram if you don't have fritzing.

After a successful first on my project the RGB LED decided it was done with me
I figured it would be worth it as its colours werew unstable and it just 
wasn't coping very well with the vigorous colour changes. I will be switching 
to individual LEDs as I feel as if they would also be code and understand. 
A fritzing diagram for this will shortly follow.
