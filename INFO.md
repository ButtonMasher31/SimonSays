SimonSays   Project #01   10 December 2017

I got the idea for this project when I was browsing the internet and I 
realised how many versions of the classic Simon Says games there.  I was 
thinking about how they worked and I realised it wouldn't be that hard to make
one, so that's what I ended up doing. Included is the python script and 
fritzing files
